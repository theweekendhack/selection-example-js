Develop a program that will read two numbers and an integer code from the keyboard. The value of the integer code MUST be 1, 2, 3 or 4. 

- If the value of the code is 1, compute the sum of the two numbers.
- If the code is 2, compute the difference (first minus second).
- If the code is 3, compute the product of the two numbers. 
- If the code is 4, and the second number is not zero, compute the quotient (first divided by the second). 
- If the code is not equal to 1, 2, 3 or 4, display an error message. 

The program then displays the two numbers, the integer code and the computed result on the screen.
